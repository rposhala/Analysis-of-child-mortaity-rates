# Analysis of child mortality rates

According to UNICEF, “An estimated 5.3 million children under age five died in 2018–roughly half of those deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa”. Even though there has been a remarkable progress in reducing the mortality rates globally, the major causes of death vary widely across countries. Despite the challenges in understanding and addressing infant mortality, it is crucial to study this to improve the collective health of a nation.

Thus, the objective of the project is to identify the factors affecting child mortality rate across the world by analyzing the data from all the countries under UNICEF surveillance. The following report is a brief overview of the proposed analysis and milestones for the project.
